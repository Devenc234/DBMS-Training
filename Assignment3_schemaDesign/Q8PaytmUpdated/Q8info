Design a database schema for a banking app using the E-R model and design tables accordingly using the relationship model. The necessary information is given below :

 

Entities : Accounts, Customer, Branches

Each customer must have an account. Joint accounts are allowed.

A customer can have multiple accounts in different branch, but not in same branch.

A branch can have many accounts.


Assume columns accordingly and mention primary keys, weak and strong entities.

















Primary Keys:


Accounts
---------
ac_number


Customer
---------
idCustomer 
Primary_ac (FK Accounts)


AllAccounts
------------
branchID (FK Customer)
customer ID (FK Braches)

From the constraint that one branch should have one customer account only

Branches
--------
idBranches



(Strong) Branches -------------- AllAccounts (weak)
(Strong) Accounts -------------- AllAccounts (weak)
(Strong) Customers -------------- AllAccounts (weak)
(Strong) Accounts -------------- Customer (weak)
